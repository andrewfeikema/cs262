Project proposals:

    A COVID contact tracing app using the Apple/Google Exposure Notification API. The application would be anonymous, as is the API, but integrations with Calvin-specific information could be beneficial as well.
    An ‘unpredictable’ application satirizing a certain industry or business. The app should be extremely frustrating
