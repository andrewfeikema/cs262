About me:

    Demographics
        I am a Junior Computer Science BCS major. In 112 and 212 I received an A
    
    Technical

        My most rigorous technical experience was working in my software development internship last summer. Within a cloud computing environment, I gained experience with NoSQL databases, Microservices, NodeJS, event-driven architecture. I have briefly studied SQL databases, and I am excited to learn how to use that structure. I have also worked with REST APIs and GraphQL APIs.
        I have worked with all of these tools
            Slack- more than 2 years in casual & professional settings
            Trello- used with a student organization to track deadlines and progress
            Git and GitHub- used in summer internship for version control of code base for templates, microservices, and frontend platform to store personal projects 
        
    Interest
        I’m interested in Ben DeVries’ idea for the deskie package notification service. I see great potential in use for cloud services in storing, processing, and exchanging information, and using event-driven architecture for notifications.  
    
    Personality

        My top big-five personality type is Openness. I took the test earlier and submitted numerical responses to the google form.
        I’d like to work with Ben Devries, Emily Costa, and Coleman Ulry. We liked working together in Discrete Mathematics occasionally, and we’d like to do it for this project.
