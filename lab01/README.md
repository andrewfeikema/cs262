# Project Description
FIRSTPROJECT is a simple app that displays the text "Hello Andrew"


## File descriptions
App.js (App.tsx)

* Defines the 'root' of the application specifying the content and CSS style for that content. I chose the build the project with Typescript as I prefer the addition of type definitions in the language.
package.json
* Declares the set of dependencies and scripts necessary for the project through definitions in a JSON object. 

node_modules

* Folder containing the source code of all imported packages from npm declared in package.json

.gitignore

* A list of names of files not to be recognized by git for version control. This prevents large packages (especially in node_modules) from being uploaded to repositories such as github.
